  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Professor Dan Ariely, from Duke University, conducted an experiment in which some people were asked to build a doll with lego pieces in exchange for $3. When the doll was finished, he kept it and asked if the person would like to assemble another one, this time for 30 cents less. And so on, until the value became too low for the person, and they no longer accepted the task.</p>

<p>For a second group of people, Dan did the same experiment, but now - instead of keeping the first doll - he disassembled it in front of the person while they assembled the second doll. Once this second doll was finished, he again asked if the person wanted to assemble another one for 30 cents less, and then handed them the dismantled parts of the first one.</p>

<p>That is: for the second group, the work became cyclical. Instead of accumulating several dolls, the person assembled and reassembled the same ones.</p>

<p>Which group do you think accepted to assemble more dolls? That’s right: the first. And it’s easy to understand why, right? The cyclical aspect of the work removes something very important from it: the <strong>sense of purpose</strong>. Anyone needs to see some kind of meaning in work to be motivated. Money is not the only motivation - and, for many people, it may not even be the main one.</p>

<p>This experiment targeted the work environment, but I think it can be extended to any human task, including the task of buying. As counterintuitive as it may seem, the consumer accepts to “work” for free for the brand - as long as they see a purpose in doing so.</p>

<p>This is how the <strong>content creator-consumer</strong> appears. Customer comments and reviews on a hotel page in booking.com are content produced spontaneously, highly scalable and far more valuable than the descriptions provided by the hotels themselves. After all, we are more inclined to believe in an impartial account from a real user than in the standard corporate text of a company trying to sell itself.</p>

<p>Is this bad for your brand? Only if you see this dynamic as an enemy, and not as the ally it can be. Modern communication does not exist outside the network, and brands need to use it to their advantage. If a relevant group of people with a stronger reputation than yours is willing to make a free creative effort equivalent to what your company does internally, that means more efficiency, less cost, more reach. Instead of spending time and effort producing, validating and revalidating the stone-engraved content that will convey the soul of your business for the next hundred years, let your users produce and spread positive content about your brand (and, of course, work your core business so that this content is positive).</p>

<p>Some of the content that can turn your customer into a producing consumer are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Notes and comments on your website;</li>
  <li>Notes and comments on third party websites or applications (review platforms, marketplaces, etc.);</li>
  <li>Forum discussions;</li>
  <li>Public conversations on social networks (a thread on twitter, a comment on Facebook);</li>
  <li>Posts on social networks displaying the brand (a photo of the customer using your product, a sticker of your brand on Instagram, a review video on youtube);</li>
  <li>Posts on personal blogs about your brand;</li>
  <li>Reports of experiences with the brand.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you find it strange to think of your reader or your client as a content creator, it might be worth adjusting your mindset. You may be leaving a collaborator out of your strategy - one that can bring results with a far better Return On Investment.</p>

<p>The question is: how to give the necessary motivation for customers to become content creators, since there is no financial relationship involved? As Dan Ariely’s experiment suggests, this will happen whenever the user finds a sense of purpose in the task.</p>

<p>Perhaps they relate to the vision of your brand to the point of wanting to make that connection public; maybe they want to be useful to a community interested in your product or service; maybe they care about creating a reputation as an expert on a certain subject and showing knowledge about your brand helps in that.</p>

<p>By reflecting on the motivations and purposes that can turn your user into a producer, you may gain an important ally for your content strategy.</p>
